<h2>Data for Equity:</h2>
<p>All of our data is publicly available, and the data itself poses little to no risk of harm to the professional athletes whose data we are collecting. However, one important note to consider is the originally data aggregator’s intentions when collecting this information. The website we use for both our MLB and NBA datasets, Advanced Sports Analytics, collects this data for the purpose of creating tracking dashboards and predictive models for the purpose of sports gambling. While sports gambling can be a fun recreational activity and a mentally stimulating challenge to try to “beat” the house odds by the use of custom models, many people struggle with a gambling addiction, and it is a very serious topic. Although the data and our analysis is not intended for the purpose of sports betting, the conclusions that we draw from it could certainly be used for that purpose. In our research, we will include a disclaimer stating that our work does not have a financial incentive behind it, and that we are conducting research out of curiosity and academic pursuits. Additionally, we will include links to gambling addiction services, such as 1-800 numbers and the Gambling Addiction Anonymous website. Finally, we will provide disclaimers that our models may not be sufficiently accurate or represent the true nature of the data, and that any predictions should not be used for the purpose of sports betting. Our research will uphold all three of the principles in the Belmont report, beneficence, respect for persons, and justice. Although we believe that the risks to the sports community is low, since gambling addiction is a sensitive topic, we have included precautions and warnings to both raise awareness to potential conflicts and provide resources to help combat any individuals that might be negatively affected by our research to uphold the principle of beneficence. Our findings will be made publicly available for the betterment of the sports fan community, who might take an interest in our work to better understand trends in sports, and to have more in depth knowledge of team’s they are fans of. We believe that this measure will uphold the principle of justice.</p>

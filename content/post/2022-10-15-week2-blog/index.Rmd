## Cleaning the Data:
To begin the process of cleaning and filtering the data, we'll first want to remove any null values from our analysis. Then, to narrow down the fields in our datasets to those relevant to offensive production and any comparative fields, we'll remove fields that we do not plan to use in our analysis. For our purposes, much of a player's biographical data, like hometown, can be removed, as it won't be used in analysis. Below are some plots created with our datasets to summarize data that will be relevant to our investigation.

## Plots
The plot below filtered the NBA game-by-game dataset to find games that had at least 30 points scored by a player. Then the number of instances of 30 points being scored were plotted against the date of the games. This plot shows the trend of scoring throughout the 2021-2022 NBA season. As can be seen, there were more instances of over 10 players scoring 30+ points in a day in the second half of the season. 

``` {r 30pt_vs_date}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics('./Rplot.png')

```


The next plot filtered the NBA game-by-game dataset to find players who averaged at least 25 points per game in the 2022 season, and plotted these players against their season field goal percentage. This showed players who exceeded the average scoring of the league, being among the elite scorers and then showed their efficiency. This plot enables us to see the most efficient scorers among the league's top scorers. To make this plot, the data had to be cleaned by removing duplicate rows in the dataset, and removing games that were listed but the players did not play in. Leaving those values in would have skewed the PPG for the season as it would have added extra games. 

``` {r 25pt_vs_fg}
knitr::include_graphics('./Rplot01.png')

```


The next plot is similar to the last one, but we used the MLB dataset to find players with 500 or more plate appearances who had an OPS of .900 or better in the 2021 season. We plotted these two stats against each other to find which players were able to maintain such a high level of production over a large sample size. To clean this data, we removed rows with missing values in plate appearances, grouped by player, calculated season total stats using the sum function, and manually calculated a few stats using the variables: at-bats, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, hit-by-pitches, and plate appearances.

##Data for Equity

All of our data is publicly available, and the data itself poses little to no risk of harm to the professional athletes whose data we are collecting. However, one important note to consider is the originally data aggregator’s intentions when collecting this information. The website we use for both our MLB and NBA datasets, Advanced Sports Analytics, collects this data for the purpose of creating tracking dashboards and predictive models for the purpose of sports gambling. While sports gambling can be a fun recreational activity and a mentally stimulating challenge to try to “beat” the house odds by the use of custom models, many people struggle with a gambling addiction, and it is a very serious topic. Although the data and our analysis is not intended for the purpose of sports betting, the conclusions that we draw from it could certainly be used for that purpose. In our research, we will include a disclaimer stating that our work does not have a financial incentive behind it, and that we are conducting research out of curiosity and academic pursuits. Additionally, we will include links to gambling addiction services, such as 1-800 numbers and the Gambling Addiction Anonymous website. Finally, we will provide disclaimers that our models may not be sufficiently accurate or represent the true nature of the data, and that any predictions should not be used for the purpose of sports betting. Our research will uphold all three of the principles in the Belmont report, beneficence, respect for persons, and justice. Although we believe that the risks to the sports community is low, since gambling addiction is a sensitive topic, we have included precautions and warnings to both raise awareness to potential conflicts and provide resources to help combat any individuals that might be negatively affected by our research to uphold the principle of beneficence. Our findings will be made publicly available for the betterment of the sports fan community, who might take an interest in our work to better understand trends in sports, and to have more in depth knowledge of team’s they are fans of. We believe that this measure will uphold the principle of justice.

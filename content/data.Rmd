* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.

##describe the cleaning process
Luckily, most of our data is already cleaned, processed, and ready to be used. There are a couple of NA values that are removed, but that is the extent of the work that we have done. 

##Combining the data
Because baseball and basketball are different sports and have different stats, number of games, and pace of play, we do not think it would be helpful or relevant to merge the data in the traditional sense. However, we believe that key comparisons can be drawn between the two sports, especially in the case of the scope of our project, analyzing streakiness in players and teams. For the purposes of comparing the two leagues, we split each MLB season consisting of 162 games into the front half and second half and compare that to the 82-game season in the NBA. Our initial intuition is that a more or less direct comparison can be drawn between an NBA players number of consecutive games scoring above average and an MLB players number of consecutive games with a hit. We are also interested in drawing comparisons between the two mutual “assist” stats in the MLB and NBA, the assist in the NBA and the RBI stat for the MLB. 

## Who collected the data and why
Special thanks to the team at ASA for allowing for the free download of aggregated data. 
The data was collected for the purpose of creating projections for daily fantasy sports games, which the author offers as part of their premium monthly package. However, they offer free blogs, resources, and tools for free to help fans of sports betting make better predictions. 

##Describe the data
The data is divided in a tidy manner, where each column in the dataset is a different statistic or a game identifier. For instance, there is the team name, opponent name, date of the game, and unique game id. Each row is an individual players performance in that game. So one game will have mulitple rows comprising of the different players performances. The variable names are straight forward, and there is no ambiguity in their function. The key variables we use in the analysis that warrant highlighting are as follows, offensive rating, defensive rating, bpm, usage percentage, and true shooting percentage. 

* Offensive rating(team)
  * Players Points*Total FG%) + Opponents Differential= 1/5 of possessions - Times Fouled+ FTM* FT% * OAPOW (Official Adjusted Players Offensive Withstand)
* Offensive rating(player)
  * (Points Produced / Individual Possessions) x OAPOW × PPG + FTM/FT * 3pt% + FG% 
* Defensive rating(team)
  * (Players Steals*Blocks) + Opponents Differential= 1/5 of possessions - Times blown by + Deflections * OAPDW( Official Adjusted Players Defensive Withstand).
* Defensive rating(player)
  * Team_Defensive_Rating + 0.2 * (100 * Opponent_PTS / (Opponent_FGM + (1 - (1 - (Opponent_FTM / Opponent_FTA))^2) * Opponent_FTA*0.4) * (1 - Stop%) - Team_Defensive_Rating)
* bpm
  * uses a player’s box score information, position, and the team’s overall performance to estimate the player’s contribution in points above league average per 100 possessions played. 
* usage percentage
  * 100 * ((FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV) * (Tm MP / 5)) / (MP * (Tm FGA + 0.44 * Tm FTA + Tm TOV
* true shooting percentage
  * the formula is PTS / (2 * TSA). True shooting percentage is a measure of shooting efficiency that takes into account field goals, 3-point field goals, and free throws.

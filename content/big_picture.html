<h2>The Hot Hand. Just some Hot Air?:</h2>
<p>Oftentimes in sports, we say players are on “hot streaks” if they perform above a certain standard for multiple consecutive games. Some believe in the “hot hand”, where a player is more likely to make his next shot based on his previous performance. Similarly, “the zone” refers to a player who is seemingly in another place mentally, scoring at an unusually high clip. Some brush the “hot hand” off as sports pseudoscience, looking at each shot or opportunity to score as an isolated event. But what are streaks exactly? Can we quantify them? Is there any truth to these phenomena? We aim to define the standard against which a streak can be determined, identify streaks based on this standard, and draw comparisons between streaks in two sports leagues in particular: the NBA and the MLB.</p>

<div id="between-two-sports" class="section level2">
<h2>Between Two Sports:</h2>
<p>One way we decided to assess the validity of streaks was by looking at two different sports. Basketball nd baseball are extremely different sports in many aspect, such as playstyle, team size, season length, game structure, offense and defense schemes, and much much more. This difference however may aid in determining sports. If we were to look at only one sport, and found that players really did get the hot hand, it may return a false-positive. We aim to see if the streakiness of players and teams are localized to their respective sports, or certain transcendental properties emerge between the two sports. Due to the differences in the leagues’ formats and the natures of each sport, we will perform our analyses with respect to each league and then comparatively analyze the leagues to draw conclusions on the nature and impact of streaks on the league, respectively.</p>

<h2>What Will We Find? Who cares? :</h2>
<p>We have defined streaks as a player performing above their average in a specific stat, or a combination of stats in a number of successive games. We suggest that not only is there a method to predict when these players get on “hot streaks,” but we can perform similar analyses across different sports, and even identify whether certain players are “streaky” in general. If you participate in fantasy sports leagues, our findings may help you get a leg up in your workplace league, anticipating breakout players or finding players that may give you that extra boost you need to finally beat Martha in accounting. If you place bets on games, our findings may help you break out of your slump… and get back the money you lost from betting on the Sacramento Kings to win it all. If you are simply interested in sports and want to have a new way to assess player output and find trends within our data, then our findings are for you.</p>
